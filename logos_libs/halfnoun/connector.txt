Information regarding connectors for halfnouns
----------------------------------------------

Note: In the following we use pat for the pat_number column
      and stem for stem_number or source_stem_number columns.
      Description fields on tables are omitted.

We will determine possible connectors from information
stored in the following areas. It is assumed words are normalized
ie in lower case with eszett replaced by "ss" - but the un-normalized
form of the word is also stored.

There is a general restriction that if a word already ends in a
connector, then that connector is invalid. For the "s" connector
a word may not end in 's', 'x', 'z', or 'sch'. This overrides
any rules below.

For stored half-nouns, or either of the aritmetic types or if either the
pat or stem is null (remapped to 0) no connector is allowed.

For verbs, nouns or adjectives apply the following rules in order.
Only verbs, adjectives or nouns should be entered in the tables.

1. Search at the morphology level (in the halfnoun_morphology_connector
   table).

   The halfnoun_morphology_connector table has the following layout:

   column-name(s)            type
   --------------            ----
   language_code             char[2]
   word                      string
   pat_number                int     = number
   source_stem_number        int     = number
   no_connector              boolean = char[1]
   s_connector               boolean = char[1]
   es_connector              boolean = char[1]
   er_connector              boolean = char[1]
   en_connector              boolean = char[1]
   n_connector               boolean = char[1]
   nen_connector             boolean = char[1]
   e_connector               boolean = char[1]

  The word/pat/stem is the primary key for this table. company_code is
  always 'LOG' for these items.
  Given a key we get a list of boolean flags for the connectors. If a
  flag is set for a connector that connector will apply for the word.
  The no_connector flag means that it is allowed to have no connector.

  Note: At least one flag must be set to true (due to the no_connector
  meaning).

  Note: the list of connectors is fixed in the table. If a new connector
  needs to be added the table layout will need to be changed - and of
  course a programmatic change will need to occur as well. This applies
  to all similar tables and is intentional.

2. If not found above, search at the word level (in the .ini file).

   If a word ends in a string in the "s_connector_list"
   and the word does not end in a string in the
   "s_connector_exception" list then that word will
   take an "s" connector or no connector.

   If a word ends in a string in the "no_connector_list"
   and the word does not end in a string in the
   "no_connector_exception" list then that word will not
   take any connectors.

3. If not found above, search at the pat/stem/last_letter level
   (in the halfnoun_pat_stem and halfnoun_letter_group tables).

   The halfnoun_letter_group table has the following layout:

   column-name(s)            type
   --------------            ----
   letter_group_id           int = number
   letters                   string

   The primary key is the letter_group_id. Each row represents a group
   of letters which are referred to in the halfnoun_pat_stem table.

   The halfnoun_pat_stem table has the following layout.

   column-name(s)            type
   --------------            ----
   language_code             char[2]
   pat_number                int     = number
   source_stem_number        int     = number
   letter_group_id           int     = number
   no_connector              boolean = char[1]
   s_connector               boolean = char[1]
   es_connector              boolean = char[1]
   er_connector              boolean = char[1]
   en_connector              boolean = char[1]
   n_connector               boolean = char[1]
   nen_connector             boolean = char[1]
   e_connector               boolean = char[1]

   The letter_group_id is a foreign key to the letter_group table.
   The language_code/pat/stem/letter_group_id form the primary key on
   this table. We restrict to language code for German.

   Given a pat/stem combination and the last letter of a word
   (in lowercase), we can lookup the pat/stem/last-letter in the join of
   this table with the letter_group table. We get a list of boolean flags
   for the connectors. Proceed as per halfnoun_morphology_connector table.

4. If not found above, search at the pat/stem level
   (in the halfnoun_pat_stem_default table).

   The halfnoun_pat_stem_default table has the following layout:

   column-name(s)            type
   --------------            ----
   language_code             char[2]
   pat_number                int     = number
   source_stem_number        int     = number
   no_connector              boolean = char[1]
   s_connector               boolean = char[1]
   es_connector              boolean = char[1]
   er_connector              boolean = char[1]
   en_connector              boolean = char[1]
   n_connector               boolean = char[1]
   nen_connector             boolean = char[1]
   e_connector               boolean = char[1]

   The language_code/pat/stem form the primary key on this table.
   We restrict to language code for German.
   Given a pat/stem combination we get a list of boolean flags for
   the connectors. Proceed as per halfnoun_morphology_connector table.

5. If not found above, use the following defaults:

   verbs:             "e" connector or no-connector
   others:            all connectors including no-connector
                                     excluding e-connector
                                     excluding nen-connector

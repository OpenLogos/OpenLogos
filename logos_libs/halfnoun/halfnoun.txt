Building half-noun cache
------------------------

Note: In the following we use pat for the pat_number column
      and stem for stem_number or source_stem_number columns.

   The .ini file contains a section called "sal_exclusion" containing the fields:
   word-class/superset/set/subset as well as a status which can be 'H', 'I', or 'X'.
   word-class can only be 01, 02, 04.

   If the value is 'H' (head) the word can only appear in the head position.
   For example nominalized infinitives and present participles are in this category.

   If the value is 'N' (non-head) the word can only appear in a non-head position.

   If the value is 'X' (exclude) the word will be excluded from the cache.
   For example proper nouns are in this category.

   If the value is 'I' (include) the word can be used in any position.

   Similarly the "word_exclusion" and "ending_exclusion" sections will restrict,
   include or exclude words from the cache, based on whether the word matches or
   ends in an ending in the list. Also the pat_stem_exclusion section restricts
   words similarly, based on the pat and stem values.

   If there is a conflict between the above sections the precedence order is
   word_exclusion, ending_exclusion, pat_stem_exclusion, sal_exclusion.

   For stored halfnouns, the only non-default status that will be honoured is
   the 'X' status, which will remove the word from the cache.
   By default stored halfnouns support the 'N' status, so this is also honoured.

   The database view german_pat_stem is the union of the tables
   halfnoun_pat_stem_default and halfnoun_pat_stem tables,
   restricted to pat/stem for language_code = '01' (German).

1. Join the word_phrase, morphology, meaning tables. Restrictions:
       German words - language_code = '01'
       only alphabetic characters - no spaces, hyphens, or other characters
       only words of length 3 or more
       non-abbreviations - word_type = '01'
       source words - source_analysis_code = '1' and primary_switch = 'Y'
       word_class - only '01', '02', '04', '14', '16
   The following columns are used:
       company_code, word, word_class, pat/stem, superset/set/subset

2. Nouns: Select a subset of the join. Select only word_class = '01'
   For the head-word all pat/stem combinations and all supersets are accepted;
   For a non-head-word only the following pat/stem combinations are accepted:
       stem = '01', any pat (canonical form)
       pat/stem in the german_pat_stem view restricted to German nouns

3. Adjectives and stored half-nouns:
   Select a subset of the join. Select only word_class = '04'
   Stored half-nouns have a pat of 485, adjectives do not.
   (stored half-nouns always have a stem of '01')
   Only adjectives can appear as the head-word.
   For the head-word all pat/stem combinations are accepted;
   For a non-head-word only the following pat/stem combinations are accepted:
       stem = '01', any pat (canonical form)
       pat/stem in the german_pat_stem view restricted to German adjectives

4. Verbs: Select a subset of the join. Select only word_class = '02'
   For the head-word all pat/stem combinations are accepted;
   For a non-head-word only the following pat/stem combinations are accepted:
       pat/stem in the german_pat_stem view restricted to German verbs.

5. Arithmetic types: Select a subset of the join. Select only word_class = '14' or '16'
   All pat/stem combinations are accepted for the head or non-head positions.

6. Take the union of 2-5 above. Remap the word class as follows:
        wc  part-of-speech      head-word     non-head-word
        --  --------------      ---------     ----------
        1   noun                yes           no
        2   noun                yes           yes
        3   adjective           yes           no
        4   adjective           yes           yes
        5   verb                yes           no
        6   verb                yes           yes
        7   stored half-noun    no            yes
        8   arithmetic-14       yes           yes
        9   arithmetic-16       yes           yes
       10   special-word        no            yes
            e.g. Ballet (from noun Ballett with doubled consonant removed)
            must be followed by a word beginning with the same consonant
            ('t' in this case)

7. For all records which allow head-words calculate possible
   endings using the pat/stem/language as a key into the derived_form table.
   if the pat or stem is null (remapped to 0) no endings are allowed.

8. Connector information is calculated for non-head words
   as per connector.txt file

9. The cache is built from the above table. There will be one record for each
   company-code/word/word_class/pat/stem combination
   with connector, ending information included.

   Both the un-normalized (original) word and normalized word is stored.
   The normalized form is stored in lower case with eszett replaced by "ss".
   For word-class 2 only, if a normalized word ends in a doubled
   consonant (except for s) we will add an extra entry into the cache
   with the last letter removed in the normalized word - the unnormalized
   word remains unchanged along with all the connector flags. This enables
   the cache to split a word like "Balettheater" to "Balett Theater";
   the new spelling is "Baletttheater".

Context of decomposition criteria.
----------------------------------

   The following possibilities of the head-word occur:
     a. compound word consists only of non-head-words
     b. head-word is a noun
     c. head-word is an adjective
     d. head-word is a verb
     e. head-word is a noun or an adjective
   Whether the search word is in all upper-case or not.
   The company_code list.

Untranslated compounds
----------------------

Certain names of cities, etc should not be decomposed.
The [no_decomposition] section in the .ini file lists
file names of files containing words that should not be
decomposed.

These are loaded into memory and for every input word,
if the word occurs in one of these files, the word is
not decomposed.

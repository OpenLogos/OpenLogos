DAYTON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 13, 1996--Amcast Industrial
Corporation (NYSE:AIZ) today reported sales and earnings for the
three-month period ended March 3.
   On sales of $81.8 million, net income was $3.9 million (46 cents
per share).  For the comparable quarter of 1995, sales were $81.8
million and net income was a record $4.3 million (50 cents per
share).
   For the first half of fiscal 1996, sales were $168.3 million and
net income was $8.0 million (93 cents per share) compared to sales of
$158.8 million and net income of $7.9 million (93 cents per share)
for the first six months last year.  These results were achieved
despite cutbacks in automotive production schedules and severe winter
weather conditions that affected sales and operations.
   The company's two largest automotive customers, General Motors
and Ford, have implemented production schedules that are
approximately 11 percent below the first calendar quarter of 1995,
impacting Amcast units that produce brake, chassis, and climate
control system components.
   Sales in the company's engineered components segment were $43.7
million in the second quarter of 1996 compared to $44.8 million in
the second quarter of fiscal 1995.  Operating income for this segment
was $1.7 million in the current year versus $2.0 million a year ago.
The shortfall is primarily due to reduced volume of automotive brake
and climate control components, partially offset by strong demand for
aluminum wheel models produced by the company.
